## Getting Started

Download the releases from [here](https://github.com/AliKarpuzoglu/DrBibber-VR/releases)

### Prerequisites

You need an HTC Vive to run. You could technically play it with a mouse and keyboard but that’s not a lot of fun.

```
The game currently only runs on the HTC Vive.
```

## How to Play
The goal of the game is to remove all items from the body of the patient. The game is timed and has a local high score list to compete with friends and family.   
The game is started by touching the ‘start game’  button floating next to the patient. You need to be remove the items from the patient and throw them into the bin next to the bed. Do this without touching the body of the patient.
